You click on a page and instantly the program runs you will have a fair idea of where it came from.  It sits dormant for a week or more and you can forget knowing off hand where it came from.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They will ask for $200 or more from normal people.  They might ask for $20,000 or more from a larger company, who is their main target.  Where I work we have a policy that certain computers need to never be on the internet in any form.  To get data off of them you must either right to a new cd or use a flash drive that is fresh out of the package.  Once the flash drive is removed it can not be placed in that machine again.  The drives used for weekly backups are labeled with the label wrapping around the usb port and placed into a safe.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
